        <div id="about__box" class="box">
            <p>"I'm Basheer Ammar, 19 years old, currently living in United Arab Emirates, and I really like coding.
                I learned Python at first, then I started learning a little bit of HTML and CSS, after that I wanted to
                learn more so I started learning Java, I didn't really like java that much, so, i decided to change a
                little bit, most likly because of how much I saw about the uses of Javascript, ofcourse I started
                learning Javascript, and if I want to learn Javascript I need to make sites and get good at using HTML
                and CSS, so I made this website.
                <strong>This is the first website I've ever made.</strong>"

                ---
                <br>
                This is the introduction I wrote back in 2021, when I first made this website.
                <br>
                <strong>2023 Update:</strong>
                <br>
                I'm currently studying at 42 Abu Dhabi, I've finished many
                projects and I was able to enhance my soft and hard skills.
